so its simple, straight to the point, but still pleasant and easy to comprehend.
* The flower represents nature and its relationship with Yoga.
2. Background
* The backgorund is a photograph of a park, that resembles one of the spaces yoga can take place at,
the nature represents the calmness the exercise can bring to people's lives.
* The background was also chosen because of its autumn colours, which resemble the colour theme of the project.
3. Main picture
* Photograph of a yogi, doing the 'lord of the dance' pose, its inviting and creates curiosity for new visitors on the site.
It also acts as a reflection of what users can expect in the near future.
* This the colours in the photo compliment the colour theme of the project

* These videos can act as a tool for practice at home, as well as just for entertainment.

* The colors of the website; white, green, and white go back to the logo, to keep it simple but still vibrant.
* These colors represent nature, peace, happiness, hope and renewal,
6. Fonts
* **Sora** was chosen for being very clear to read but still playfull.
* **Piedra** was chosen because of how playfull and fun it looks, which is what many yogis strive for.
* **Montserrat** was used because just as Sora its playfull and curvy enough to resemble yoga moves.
