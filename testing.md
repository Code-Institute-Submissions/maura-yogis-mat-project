## Cross Browser Testing
1. Chrome
* On the Chrome browser, the website loads at a reasonable rate, the photos take longer to load,
however once its loaded more than once it loads faster everytime.
* <img src="assets/images/.png" title="logo">
* 
2. Safari
* The website loads very quicly on the Safari browser
* The circular image appears differntly to when on the Chrome browser
* 
3. Firefox 
* The page loads faster on the Firefox browser than on Chrome or Safari
* The contact page, on Firefox acts slightly different than on safari or Chrome, 
the required boxes, turn read when empty.

## Testing on desktop and mobile phones
- On mobile phones, the circular image takes longer to appear
- The images are as clear on the mobile phone as they are on a desktop

## Unsolved Bugs
* The circular picture, is more centered when shown on Safari, when on Chrome it goes over the footer (as intended)

## Overall
* The website is readable on both big and small devices, on big screens like computers, the writing is visible as well as the pictures.
On small devices everything is also very clear, the one issue it contains when switching from small to bigger screens and vice versa
are the photos. the photo placed on the circular container changes sizes when on a smaller screen however, at a cost of the whole image itself.
* The **Contact Us** page is straight forward, and it works well.
