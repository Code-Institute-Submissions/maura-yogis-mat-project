# Testing for |The Yoga Mat

* The website is readable on both big and small devices, on big screens like computers, the writing is visible as well as the pictures.
On small devices everything is also very clear, the one issue it contains when switching from small to bigger screens and vice versa
are the photos. the photo placed on the circular container changes sizes when on a smaller screen however, at a cost of the whole image itself.
* The **Contact Us** page is straight forward, and it works well.
